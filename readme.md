#Educational Purposes
This script simply serves the purpose of illustrating, at a very high level,
what happens when a web page is requested on any server. Though this looks a
lot like the default apache behavior, my intention is more to show how simple
serving web pages can really be (and not necessarily the default apache
config).

#Use
+ Make requests, just like you would with any browser

  ```bash
  ./server some/path/blah
  ```

+ Run the following to see a sitemap:

  ```bash
  ./server sitemap
  ```
